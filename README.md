# MethodsPaper

This repository contains R scripts for modeling bacterial growth and respiration from oxygen time series data.

## Contents

- `CUE.R`: Script for fitting temperature-dependent carbon use efficiency (CUE) models.
- `PaperScript.R`: Full analysis pipeline for estimating growth and respiration rates across treatments.

## Description

The scripts reproduce the analyses used in the manuscript on microbial respiration-growth coupling under environmental stress. Models include nonlinear fits, temperature response (Arrhenius, Schoolfield), and carbon unit conversions.
